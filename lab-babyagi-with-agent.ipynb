      "2. **Explore Fisherman's Wharf**: Visit Pier 39, see the sea lions, and walk along the waterfront to take in the views of the Bay Bridge. Don't forget to try some of San Francisco's famous seafood or Italian cuisine for dinner.\n",
      "3. **Take a Tour of Alcatraz Island**: Book a tour of the former prison and take a ferry to the island to learn about the history of the prison and its infamous inmates.\n",

The TODO tool compounds this by returning multi-paragraph responses that accumulate in the `agent_scratchpad` and are resent to the LLM on every step. For focused factual questions, `max_iterations=1` and removing the TODO tool would cut runtime and token usage significantly. |\n\n### What we learned\n- **Completion models ≠ chat models**: Legacy LangChain agents like `ZeroShotAgent` were built around OpenAI's completion API. Chat models need explicit, strict format instructions to follow the ReAct pattern reliably.\n- **Objective design matters for agentic systems**: An open-ended objective like *\"Write a weather report\"* reads as a project to BabyAGI and spawns unbounded sub-tasks. A well-scoped question like *\"What are the top 3 things to do in SF this weekend?\"* gives the system a natural stopping condition.\n- **Stateful objects need full resets**: Any object that accumulates state (vectorstore, agent) must be fully reconstructed between runs — partial resets silently fail.\n- **Context grows multiplicatively**: Each BabyAGI iteration × agent steps × tool response length compounds quickly. In agentic systems, verbose tools (like TODO) are a hidden cost — every character they return gets carried forward in the scratchpad for all subsequent LLM calls."
